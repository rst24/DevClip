## üìù Dev.to Article

**Title:** I Built an AI Clipboard Manager for Developers (And You Can Use It Free)

**Tags:** #webdev #ai #productivity #showdev

**Article Body:**

## Why I Built DevClip

As a developer, I found myself constantly:
1. Copying unformatted JSON from API responses
2. Pasting minified code from production into formatters
3. Struggling to understand legacy code without docs
4. Losing track of code snippets I'd formatted hours ago

Existing tools solved parts of this, but nothing combined **local formatting** (privacy) with **AI assistance** (OpenAI) and **cloud sync** (convenience).

So I built **DevClip**.

## What Is DevClip?

DevClip is a browser extension + web app that gives developers:

### 1. Universal Code Formatter
- Supports 13 languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, TSX, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Less, Vue, JSON, YAML, GraphQL, Markdown
- Auto-detects language from code patterns
- Runs 100% client-side using Prettier (your code never leaves your browser)
- Works offline, no account required

### 2. AI-Powered Code Tools (OpenAI)
- **Explain Code:** Paste a complex function, get a plain-English breakdown
- **Refactor Code:** Auto-optimize for readability and performance
- **Summarize Logs:** Extract key errors from verbose application logs
- Tiered AI models: Free tier uses efficient models, Pro/Team get premium quality

### 3. Cloud Clipboard
- Save formatted snippets to the cloud
- Sync across devices
- Search and favorite your most-used code

### 4. REST API
- Integrate formatters and AI tools into CI/CD pipelines
- Bearer token authentication
- Perfect for agentic workflows

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript  
**Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon) with Drizzle ORM  
**Auth:** Replit Auth (Google, GitHub, Apple, X SSO)  
**Payments:** Stripe Checkout  
**AI:** OpenAI API (tiered models based on subscription plan)  
**Formatting:** Prettier (13 language plugins)

## Pricing Philosophy

I wanted DevClip to be accessible to individual developers while sustainable as a business:

- **Free:** 50 AI credits/month, unlimited formatters, cloud sync
- **Pro ($4.99/month):** 5,000 AI credits, credit carryover (max 10K), up to 6 API keys
- **Team ($24.99/month):** 25,000 shared credits, unlimited API keys, team features

All formatting is free forever. You only pay for AI features.

## Challenges I Faced

### 1. Language Auto-Detection
Initially, my regex patterns misclassified JSON as JavaScript (both start with `{`). I had to implement a **critical ordering system**:
1. Check frameworks first (Vue, TSX, JSX)
2. Check JSON before JavaScript
3. Check JavaScript before CSS

This reduced misclassification from ~30% to <5%.

### 2. Credit System Architecture
Implementing a fair credit system required:
- Pre-flight credit checks (reject if balance = 0)
- Atomic deduction (prevent race conditions)
- Credit carryover with limits (10K Pro, 50K Team)
- Monthly reset cron job

### 3. Stripe Webhook Security
I had to validate webhook signatures, handle idempotency, and manage subscription lifecycle events (`customer.subscription.updated`, `invoice.payment_failed`, etc.).

## What's Next?

**Post-launch roadmap:**
- VS Code extension
- Team collaboration features (shared snippet libraries)
- Support for more languages (Python, Go, Rust)
- Advanced analytics dashboard

## üìß Email Template (Early Adopter Outreach)

**Subject:** I built DevClip‚Äîget 1,000 free AI credits as an early adopter

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I wanted to reach out personally because I know you work with [JavaScript/TypeScript/APIs/etc.] a lot, and I just launched a tool I think you'll find useful.

**DevClip** is an AI-powered clipboard manager for developers. It:

‚ú® Formats code in 13 languages (JS, TS, JSON, YAML, SQL+) instantly  
ü§ñ Explains complex code in plain English using OpenAI  
‚òÅÔ∏è Syncs your clipboard history across devices  
üîå Works as a browser extension + REST API

**Why I'm reaching out:**

I'm offering **1,000 free AI credits** to the first 50 developers who sign up. That's 20x the free tier and enough to process ~200-500 AI operations.

**To claim your credits:**
1. Sign up at https://devclip.xyz
2. Reply to this email with your account email
3. I'll manually add 1,000 credits to your account

**Quick FAQ:**

*Do I need a credit card?*  
Nope! The free tier (50 credits/month) requires no payment info.

*Is my code private?*  
Yes. All formatting happens locally in your browser. AI features send code to OpenAI's API for processing (same privacy as ChatGPT), but we never store your code on our servers.

*Can I cancel the Pro plan anytime?*  
Absolutely. Cancel instantly from your dashboard. Your plan stays active until the end of your billing period.

**I'd love your feedback:**

This is v1.0, and I'm actively iterating based on user feedback. If you try it, let me know what works, what doesn't, and what features would make DevClip essential to your workflow.

Thanks for being an early supporter!

Best,  
[Your Name]

P.S. If DevClip saves you even 5 minutes this week, it's already worth it üòä

## üìù FAQ for Launch Responders

**Q: How is this different from [online JSON formatter]?**  
A: DevClip combines offline formatters (13 languages, not just JSON) with AI-powered code tools and cloud sync. Think of it as "Prettier + ChatGPT + clipboard manager" in one tool.

**Q: Why do you charge for AI features?**  
A: OpenAI charges us per API call for AI features. The free tier (50 credits/month) lets you test it out. Heavy users can upgrade to Pro for $8.99/month (5,000 credits).

A: Nope! All formatting happens in your browser using Prettier. AI features send code to OpenAI's API (same as ChatGPT), but we never store it.

**Q: Can I self-host this?**  
A: Not yet, but it's on the roadmap. The browser extension is open-source (Manifest V3), and I'm considering open-sourcing the formatter under MIT license.

**Q: Do you support [language X]?**  
A: Currently: JS, TS, JSX, TSX, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Less, Vue, JSON, YAML, GraphQL, Markdown. Python, Go, and Rust are next on the roadmap!
