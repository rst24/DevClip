# DevClip - Production Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Deploying to Production on Replit

### Overview
Your DevClip application is production-ready! This guide will walk you through deploying it to production, connecting a custom domain, and distributing the browser extension.

---

## üì¶ Step 1: Publish Your App on Replit

### 1.1 Access Publishing
1. Click the **"Publish"** button at the top of your Replit workspace
2. Or navigate to **Tools** ‚Üí **Publishing**

### 1.2 Choose Deployment Type
For DevClip, choose **Autoscale Deployment** (recommended):
- ‚úÖ Automatically scales with traffic
- ‚úÖ Ideal for web apps and APIs
- ‚úÖ Pay only for what you use
- ‚úÖ Handles variable user loads efficiently

### 1.3 Configure Deployment
1. **Machine Power**: Start with **1 vCPU / 1 GB RAM** (you can upgrade later)
2. **Max Machines**: Set to **3** for moderate scaling
3. **Run Command**: Should be pre-configured as `npm run dev`
4. **Environment Variables**: 
   - All your secrets are already configured (DATABASE_URL, STRIPE keys, etc.)
   - Verify critical variables are set in Secrets panel:
     - ‚úÖ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
     - ‚úÖ `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID`
     - ‚úÖ `STRIPE_TEAM_PRICE_ID`
     - ‚úÖ `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`
     - ‚úÖ `SESSION_SECRET`
     - ‚úÖ `DATABASE_URL`

### 1.4 Configure Stripe Webhook
**IMPORTANT**: After deployment, you must configure your Stripe webhook:

1. Note your deployment URL (e.g., `https://devclip.replit.app`)
2. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
3. Click **"Add endpoint"**
4. Enter webhook URL: `https://devclip.replit.app/api/webhooks/stripe`
5. Select events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
6. Copy the **Signing Secret** (starts with `whsec_...`)
7. Add it to your Replit Secrets as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 1.5 Add Payment Method
- If prompted, add a payment method
- Publishing costs are deducted from your monthly Replit credits first
- Usage-based fees apply after credits are exhausted

### 1.6 Launch!
1. Click **"Publish"**
2. Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment
3. Your app will be live at: `https://[your-repl-name].replit.app`

---

## üåê Step 2: Connect Custom Domain (devclip.org)

### 2.1 Purchase Domain
1. Buy `devclip.org` from a domain registrar:
   - **Recommended**: Namecheap, Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Porkbun
   - Cost: ~$10-15/year for `.org` domains

### 2.2 Configure Domain in Replit
1. Go to **Deployments** ‚Üí **Settings** tab in your Replit workspace
2. Click **"Link a domain"** or **"Manually connect from another registrar"**
3. Enter your domain: `devclip.org`
4. Replit will show DNS records you need to add:
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 34.132.134.162 (or IP provided by Replit)
   
   Type: TXT
   Name: _replit-challenge
   Value: [verification string from Replit]
   ```

### 2.3 Update DNS at Your Registrar
**For Namecheap:**
1. Log in ‚Üí Domain List ‚Üí Manage
2. Advanced DNS ‚Üí Add New Record
3. Add the A record and TXT record from Replit

**For Cloudflare:**
1. Log in ‚Üí Select domain ‚Üí DNS
2. Add Record
3. **IMPORTANT**: Disable the orange cloud (proxy) for the A record
4. Add both A and TXT records

**For GoDaddy:**
1. Log in ‚Üí My Products ‚Üí DNS Management
2. Add ‚Üí A Record and TXT Record

### 2.4 Wait for DNS Propagation
- Propagation can take **5 minutes to 48 hours**
- Check status in Replit's Deployments ‚Üí Settings
- When complete, you'll see **"Verified"** status
- Replit automatically provides **free SSL/HTTPS** for your domain

### 2.5 Update Your Application
Once the domain is verified, update these references in your code:
- Update SEO meta tags in `Landing.tsx` to use `devclip.org`
- Update any hardcoded URLs to use your custom domain
- Test Stripe webhooks with the new domain URL

## üß© Step 3: Distribute Browser Extension

### 3.1 Installation Instructions Created
I've created `extension/INSTALLATION.md` with complete instructions for:
- Installing unpacked extension in Chrome/Edge
- Configuring API keys
- Using local formatters vs. AI tools
- Troubleshooting common issues

### 3.2 Share Extension (Current Method)
1. **Zip the extension folder**:

   zip -r devclip-extension.zip . -x "*.DS_Store"
   ```
2. **Distribute via**:
   - Direct download from your website
   - GitHub releases
   - Email to customers
3. **Users install using**:
   - Developer Mode ‚Üí Load Unpacked (see INSTALLATION.md)

### 3.3 Chrome Web Store (Future - Recommended)
**When you're ready for public distribution:**

1. **Prepare Assets** (Required by Chrome Web Store):
   - 128x128 icon PNG (required)
   - 440x280 promo screenshot (required)
   - Detailed description (at least 132 characters)
   - Privacy policy URL

2. **Create Developer Account**:
